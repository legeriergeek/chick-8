Some awfully written Chip 8 emulator because fun i guess

# Stack
* Python
* Pygame

# Infos
First, it's poorly written as i am a dumbass
It is maped for AZERTY where
1 2 3 C\
4 5 6 D\
7 8 9 E\
A 0 B F

is mapped like (numbers are not the numpad ones)

1 2 3 4\
A Z E R\
Q S D F\
W X C V

It implement base Chip 8, and should be sorta accurate. It should have most of the opcodes, tho maybe some are lacking

### Also don't execpt this to be good
